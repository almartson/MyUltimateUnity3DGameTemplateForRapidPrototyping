# MyUltimateUnity3DGameTemplateForRapidPrototyping
A Unity3D Game Template Project with:

* Some Good Practices in Main Menu Coding Design
* State Management through a GameManager Controller class.
* The possibility of adding a Great Code Optimization proposed by Valentin Simonov, of Unity Technologies, in his publication in December 23, 2015: '10000 Update() calls' (https://blogs.unity3d.com/en/2015/12/23/1k-update-calls/). The optimization itself is in a separate Scene and inside a Folder named: \Assets\_Scenes\ThousandUpdateCallsOptimization. It can be added to the Main Game Scene by reading and understanding my other project: OneThousandCustomUpdateCalls [ https://github.com/almartson/OneThousandCustomUpdateCalls ]
